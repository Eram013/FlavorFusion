# FlavorFusion


Flavor Fusion – Office Canteen Ordering System
Flavor Fusion is a full-stack web application built using Django (Python) and a frontend powered by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s designed to streamline food ordering for employees in an office, connected directly to the internal canteen.

Highlights:

Full menu browsing and ordering system
Role-based admin panel for managing food items and orders
Clean, functional UI built from scratch
Payment UI included for future integration

In Progress: Payment Integration

The current payment options (Card, QR Scan, and Cash on Delivery) are UI prototypes only. No real transaction occurs yet.
This mock payment flow was built to demonstrate the intended user experience and will be integrated with a real payment gateway (like Razorpay or Stripe) in the next phase.
